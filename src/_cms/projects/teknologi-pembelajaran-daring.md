Created in collaboration with Indonesia Open University (Universitas Terbuka), ‘Teknologi Pembelajaran Daring’ is an instructional video about choosing the right technology for online learning. This instructional video employs illustrations and graphics to enhance viewers’ understanding of the subject matter.

In this project, I took part in editing, color grading, and adding illustrations and graphics.
