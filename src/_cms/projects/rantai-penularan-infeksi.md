Created in collaboration with the Ministry of Health of the Republic of Indonesia, Rantai Penularan Infeksi is an instructional video about the chain of infection presented in animated form to convey information in a short and interesting way.

Materials and voice actors were provided by the client and production team, I took part in storyboarding, illustration creation, and video animation.
